Random Shuffling: With a single click of the "Generate New Sequence" button, the numbers are instantly shuffled into a random order using the Fisher-Yates algorithm.

Interactive UI: Number cards are colorful and feature a "pop-in" animation, with staggered delays for a dynamic effect.

Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Input Validation: The app provides clear, user-friendly error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., "Start number cannot be greater than the Stop number").

Clean Codebase: The JavaScript is well-structured and heavily commented, making it easy to understand and maintain.
